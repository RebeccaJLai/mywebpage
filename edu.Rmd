# Education

<!-- essentially an adaptation of my academic CV, but less formal --> 

## MSc Research Methods of Psychological Science

In progress, due for completion August/September 2018. Supervised by [Professor Lisa M. DeBruine](http://facelab.org/People/debruine) ([Professor Ben C. Jones](https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/staff/benjones/) as second supervisor).

## Psychology MA(SocSci) Hons, First Class

I graduated from the University of Glasgow in Autumn of 2017 with a first class single honours degree in psychology, supervised by [Dr Dale J. Barr](https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/staff/dalebarr/). 

My final year project was an investigation into how emojis might impact egocentric biases in interpretation in computer mediated communication. I presented this project during the Final Year Undergraduate Conference on 24 March 2017.

I was joint recipient of The Pickford Prize for Social Psychology for the class of 2017.

# Training and Skills

**Continuing development plans**: More training opportunities and suggestions would be gratefully received. I am currently seeking PhD opporunities, with a focus on gaining teaching and mentoring experience simultaneously. 

I woould also be interested in learning how to write Praat scripts and gaining more experience with Shiny web apps.
